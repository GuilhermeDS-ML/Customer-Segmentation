# Customer Segmentation

### Objective

The goal of the project is to identify distinct groups of customers so that the company can customize its marketing and sales strategies more effectively. This is done using machine learning techniques, specifically clustering.

After clustering, we will have a final report that analyzes the characteristics of each cluster to better understand the different customer segments. This analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and needs.


### About the Data

The project uses a customer [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abisheksudarshan/customer-segmentation/data) with information such as gender, age, profession, marriage history, work experience, spending score, and family size.
